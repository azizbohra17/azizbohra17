### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aziz Bohra

## About Me
I am a passionate and dedicated Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Machine and Deep Learning Engineer. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Indiana University, Bloomington, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai in 2022. My interests lie in the field of Data Science, and I have acquired certifications in various relevant courses to further enhance my skills. I believe in gaining practical exposure to the industry, which led me to pursue internships and work on real-world projects.

## Research and Publications
In my academic journey, I have made notable contributions to the field. I devised a unique approach for the detection of the COVID-19 virus with Pneumonia using Chest X-Rays. This research work has been recognized and is currently under review in the 'Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine Journal' of Elsevier. The preprint of the paper is available on arXiv.

## Project Highlights
I am also actively involved in developing projects that showcase my skills and knowledge. Some notable projects include:

**Food Waste Management** : Developed a solution using Machine Learning techniques to address the issue of food waste.
Predicting Queue Wait Time at Hospitals: Leveraged data and Machine Learning algorithms to predict queue wait times at hospitals, optimizing patient experiences.

**Women Safety** : Built a system utilizing Machine Learning and its libraries to enhance women's safety.

## Personal Interests
Outside the realm of data, I have a diverse set of interests. I am a big enthusiast of soccer and Formula 1, following the excitement of these sports. Furthermore, I enjoy immersing myself in fictional and mystery novels, broadening my horizons and feeding my curiosity.

I invite you to explore my GitHub repositories and delve into the projects I have undertaken, demonstrating my technical prowess and passion for Data Science.

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, opportunities, or any questions you may have. Let's connect and make a difference in the world of Data Science!
